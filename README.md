# uWaterloo Alter Schedule Creator
Create a schedule from the other sections of your lectures; in case you ever miss your own.

If you've ever missed a lecture, you've probably tried attending another section to make up. If you happen to miss a lot of lectures, why not create a calendar to see all your other options?

This Chrome extension finds all the lectures from other sections and turns that information into a file that you can import into your calendar. Next time you sleep in for that early morning class, just check your calendar and try attending a later section!

You can install it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/uw-alter-schedule-creator/hgekdncfepbbjckngdphhkdbbecccolk), then head on over to Quest -> Enroll. By default, your schedule will be in list view, and here you can select the lectures that you'd like to have in the calendar. When you're ready, just hit "Download Alter Schedule" to get your .ics file, and then import it into your calendar!
